<h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
<p>Everyone loves the idea of waking up to a breakfast of warm pancakes
    topped with delights like fresh berries and sweet maple syrup, but
    cooking an entire pancake breakfast can be time-consuming and messy.
    Luckily, TikTok has a solution for that: Enter the lazy girl pancake bowl,
    a social media trend that content creators are making their
    go-to breakfastâ€¦for good reason.
</p>
<p>There are hundreds of videos about the lazy girl pancake bowl on TikTok alone,
    with users sharing their own take on the breakfast fad using hashtags like
    #PancakeBowl and #LazyGirlPancakeBowl. Always on the hunt for an easy
    breakfast idea, I was intrigued by the berry-topped creations,
    so I tried making the lazy girl pancake bowl in my own kitchen.
